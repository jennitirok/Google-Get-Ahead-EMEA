# Technical Challenge 2
This is relevant for students that are in their first or second year of Bachelor's degree.

## Number As Words
Given an **integer** representing a whole dollar amount, write some code to return the **string** representing the amount in words, as if it would be written on a real check. The amount is less than 2<sup>64</sup>. The string representation should be all lowercase and doesn’t need to include the word “and” or hyphens. The words in the output should be separated by spaces (with no leading/trailing spaces).

### Example Cases
For the input ```234```, your program should return ```“two hundred thirty four”```.

For the input ```3835217595```, your program should return ```“three billion eight hundred thirty five million two hundred seventeen thousand five hundred ninety five”```.

For the input ```19000000001```, your program should return ```“nineteen billion one”```.
